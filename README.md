## Design

DAG Questionnaire with output leaves.  
Response vector instead of weights?

## Pickup Lines

Present different lines from database to the user depending upon the time of the day.  
Generate quirky lines?

### Question Node

Most interactive nodes are question nodes. Question node contains a question and associated options for user to select from. Each option points to one or more other nodes which may also be an advice node.

Traversal to next node is decided based on the option that is selected and the current state.

*S_{t + 1} = f(S_t, x)*  
where S_t is state at time t and x represents the option that is selected.

> An example question could be: *Which of the following options most closely indicates the response you get when you ask your special someone on their choice of snacks?* The corresponding options could be:
>
> - Indifference
> - Specific name of cuisine or snack
> - Unknown (response)
> - None (of the above)
>
> Remember: the questions and responses do not matter for they could be any gibberish - they could even be generated with random vectors/weights.

### Advice Node

These are leaf nodes of the DAG. They provide information to the user.
