# Husband(c)ry

Husband(c)ry for Men: Groom Yourself to be in your Gal's Good Books.  

## Overview

Fun project (with satire) inspired by trends from early 2020s. Meant to educate myself on social movements - this project is not maintained and free to use - it will be deleted or archived on 20% deprecation of dependencies.

## Motivation

Understanding, learning and experimenting with cross-platform programming, and multi-platform application development with focus on interface.

## Design

A simple minimum viable product that traverses a path (like a linked list) or a graph (like a state machine). Most interactive nodes are question nodes. Question node contains a question and associated options for user to select from. Each option points to one or more other nodes which may also be an advice node. Traversal to next node is decided based on the option that is selected and the current state.

```tex
$$$

S_{t + 1} = function(S_t, x)

$$$

% where S_t is state at time t and x represents the option that is selected %

```

### Advice Node

- [x] Integrate AI APIs for translation and mediation.

Advice node presents an assertion followed by a possible suggestion. The suggestion is generated by external LLMs, online.

**Result** <-> **API** + **Agent** <-> **LLM**

### Further

The assets contain only a limited amount of data, which isn't the best way of doing things. Ideally, the data and external API would be on a server behind microservices, hidden from the users.

- [ ] Store responses for every game by any particular user by signing them sequentially similar to a ledger.
